title: Turn scripts into reproducible reports
---

- Scripts are a good first start, but they often just contain _what_
  you did and not _why_, and it's better to include the motivation,
  such as different figures that you looked at.
- Use R Markdown and knitr, or an iPython notebook


Now go to the page about [turning repeated code into functions](functions.html).
