title: Use version control

Zipping things up into a numbered and dated file is great, but
formal version control

- can make it easier to explore the history of changes
- to go back to an earlier state to find the source of a bug
- to try things out without worrying about breaking things that work

Now go to the page about [other resources on reproducible research](resources.html).
