title: Package functions for reuse
---

- Functions sitting deep within some project directory are not likely
  to be used again
- Packaging them up as a stand-alone thing will make it easier for you
  (and others) to reuse them.
- Also an opportunity to _document_ those functions.

Now go to the page about [version control](version_control.html).
